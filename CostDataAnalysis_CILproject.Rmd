```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

#Objective: 


#Background:



```{r, include = FALSE}
## setup the file structure so that this markdown document is in the main project folder along with the other folders noted below

DataSource <- "./data" # input raw dataset goes here
output.dir <-"./output" # output dataset writes to here
functions.dir <- "./functions" # directory for functions 

#source(file.path(functions.dir,'NewFunction.R')) # any functions that are called up by this markdown document need to be sourced here

## general functions that need to be read in. 
#library(readr)

```

# Methods


```{r, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
##this chunk is used to format the data set. 
## can use it to make settings etc.

#RawData <- read_csv(paste(DataSource,"/RawdataName.csv", sep = "")) 

#CleanData <- FormatData(RawData)  # make a function to format the data
```
